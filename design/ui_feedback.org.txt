* Appendix B-2: Client feedback on designs
- Overall, client likes UI, especially the familiar style and clear labelling
** Suggestions
- Have UI auto-open when the app is called, to avoid users from having to navigate to it.
- Introduce more padding/spacing between elements (current design is claustrophobic)
- Increase font size, since product is desktop-only
- Make the button to add a new custom rule more prominent/explicit, both via size and color if necessary.
