TODO: Reach out to Ms Rizwana
** Preparation
** Research/resource management
Wiki-style tool to help people link notes together, etc.

An orgtool specifically designed for MUN. So clearly demarcated sections for various elements, including various tools to make it easier, such as:
** 
Clause autoformatting
Position paper templating, and wordcount managers (so when you get above 550 it glows red or something).
An interface to shared google docs for resolutions.

If I want to be lazy, a silo'd electron app like franz with tabs. 
Do you know what we call a tabbed electron app? A discount browser, that's what. 
Try to keep my dignity, but CEF might be necessary.


** In conference
*** Organisers/secgen/logistics
A better method of keeping track of interactions and points.
Conference scheduling is unlikely, since there's a subtle, human aspect to that.


*** Delegates
DIAMUN rip-off:
Account+chat system with decent security, 
Ability to chat
Include autoformatting for clauses and subclauses using HTML lists
Easily share files: Dropbox/Gdrive plugin might be apt

Subject: Computer Science IA: MUN-related project 
Dear Ms Rizwana,
Thanks very much for agreeing to this; I look forward to the project. 
I was wondering, are there any specific ideas you would like to see implemented or problems you think could be solved? I don't know much about what sort of difficulties are faced by the organisers and chairs of MUN conferences, so I feel like that avenue might be worth discussing.




Alternatively, I have some potential ideas of my own which would be useful mostly to delegates at a conference:
Implementing something similar to the app we saw at DIAMUN- however, having seen and used that app I think we could build something similar but more usable.
Developing a tool to help delegates manage files and resources. For instance, a Google drive plugin that can automatically sort documents by agenda and format clauses and subclauses. 



One idea I'd be interested in developing would be some kind of tool to help delegates manage their files and resources. I was considering writing an extension to Chrome or a Google docs plugin that is tailored specifically to MUN. As a partial example, it might automatically sort documents by committee and agenda by searching for text in them.
Another idea I had was to try to implement something similar to the app we saw at DIAMUN. I have some potential ideas as to how we could build a similar thing, but learn from their mistakes and improve it.





. It would also handle some of the more tedious aspects of MUN such as generating editable templates and formatting clauses, and

Sir,
For my IA there's a company my father knows who I'll be working with over the summer. I've been talking with them about what exactly I'm doing (TODO: Details).

In this situation, would you advise that I go forward with this as my IA, or should I reach out to a teacher? My backup option is to work with Ms. Rizwana on developing a web app or browser extension that helps students handle their documents. In essence, it would be a Google Drive/Docs/etc. plugin that optimises the file manager for MUN, with features like automatically classifying and cross-referencing documents based on their text and formats, etc, and others that are to-be-determined.

IDEA: XML representation of MUN papers: Clauses, resolutions, etc.


* Teachers
* Extending something
WnR related: Perhaps re-working my extension.
Data analysis for the survey. Perhaps a generalised suite of data analysis tools. 
** Web extension


* Rewrite my calendar thing, find a good client.  
However, this would require looking at that thing again. Might be worth it: This time I could do it properly,
