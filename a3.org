** COMMENT Drafting
- Privacy concerns: Both in terms of the authorisation method used, and user ability to confirm security, de-authorise the app, etc.
- Make it run automatically in the background
- If possible, tags should also be able to capture MUN-specific information, such as the committee and agenda
- Program UI should use a format familiar to users, and not requiring intensive setup.
