*** Initial Conversation
**** Problems Faced
-
*** Discussion of Problems, Finalising Solution
- Students: Sorting and keeping track of different documents (in a way more sophisticated than normal file management, and which is cognizant of existing MUN stuff)
- Formatting documents and keeping track of conventions
- Bibliography management (although there are existing tools for this, just under-utilised)
- Solution: Google drive `add-on' that can automatically identify documents, and format them in a way that respects conventions.
*** Outlining Requirements
- Usability
- Google Drive integration, since that's something commonly used
- Sorting
- Managing research resources/references, either within documents or externally
- Automated and unobtrusive, as far as possible
- Configurable, and adaptable to different styles and workflows
