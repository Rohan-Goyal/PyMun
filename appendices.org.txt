**** COMMENT Text
- Students: Sorting and keeping track of different documents (in a way more sophisticated than normal file management, and which is cognizant of existing MUN stuff)
- Formatting documents and keeping track of conventions
- Bibliography management (although there are existing tools for this, just under-utilised)
- Solution: Google drive `add-on' that can automatically identify documents, and format them in a way that respects conventions.
